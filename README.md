# Aircon-Control-Project
Controlling the air conditioner by sending IR signals to the air conditioner using ESP32

This is implemented using the ESP32 board using its RMT peripheral. The decoding of the IR codes is done using ang Arduino and an IR receiver (PNA 4602), the code used for decoding is from Adafruit.
